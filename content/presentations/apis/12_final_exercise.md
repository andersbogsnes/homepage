# Final exercise

---

We want to refactor the api to have a `Users` table and `Listings` table in the database.

We also want to have a `listings` endpoint and a `users` endpoint.

We also want to be able to see a listing's user by going to `/listing/1/user` and vice-versa `/user/1/listings` shows the users listings
