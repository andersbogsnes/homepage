# Composition vs Inheritance

---

OOP has two powerful concepts that allow objects to interact with each other:

---

## Composition

**Compose** objects together

- Objects can contain other objects and call their methods and attributes

---

## Inheritance

- **Inherit** from other objects

- Objects can inherit from other objects and call its parents methods and attributes

- Used to **specialize** an existing class - we usually call this *subclassing*
