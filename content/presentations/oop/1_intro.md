## Representing the world in code

How do we represent the world in Python code?

---

If we want to represent a salesperson, we could represent them as a list of data

```python
james = ["James", 32, 1000]
```

---
We can extract data about our salesperson James

```python
name = james[0]
age = james[1]
sales_budget = james[3]
```

---

How does that make you feel?
