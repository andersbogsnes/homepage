## The Operator

Operators in Airflow represent a task that Airflow will run

---

### Examples of Tasks

- Move file from A to B
- Execute this code
- Run this SQL
- Send an email
- Post to Teams

---

PythonOperator and BashOperator are two examples of tasks we have already used, but Airflow comes with many operators built in.
